##   Description

Build an Simple Group chat Application which displays:

-Specifying a user name
-Message sending
-Message receiving
-Letting user know if his message couldn't be sent (e.g., the API endpoint returns an error).

The messages should be sent and received in real-time (a few second delay is good). So it should be good enough to have a real-time conversation with a couple of people.

## Run Script


```bash
npm run start
```

or using Yarn

```bash
yarn start
```

This will run the development server in your local host (http://localhost:3000)
